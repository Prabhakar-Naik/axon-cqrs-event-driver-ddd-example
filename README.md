# AxonIQ-cloud-console-server-spring-boot Example
TODO on Axon-framework using CQRS DDD pattern Using axon server as well SQL RDBMS will implement cloud base AxonIQ console also soon.....<br/>

download axon server from axoniq,<br/>
# start your axonserver java -jar axonserver.jar,<br/>
then search on browser localhost:8024 on default axonserver port<br/>
you can get interface like this.<br/><hr>

<h3>To know about axon framework along with spring boot you must know these:</h3>
@ Axon Framework Basics <br/>
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation): Axon Framework heavily relies on the CQRS pattern, where command operations (writes) are separated from query operations (reads).<br/>
Event Sourcing: Axon uses Event Sourcing to persist the state of aggregates (entities). Instead of storing the current state, it stores a series of events that represent state changes over time.<br/>
Domain-Driven Design (DDD): Axon encourages modeling your applicationâ€™s domain using DDD concepts like Aggregates, Entities, and Value Objects.<br/>
To get started, you need to add Axon Framework dependencies to your project.<br/>

# Spring Boot Integration
Axon Framework integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot, which means you can leverage Spring Boot's auto-configuration features to set up Axon components.<br/>

Spring Boot Starter: The axon-spring-boot-starter handles most of the configuration automatically, such as setting up Axon components, configuring the command bus, and integrating with the Spring context.<br/>

# Core Axon Components
Command Bus: Handles the routing of commands to their respective command handlers.<br/>
Event Bus: Handles the publishing of events to the appropriate event handlers.<br/>
Query Bus: Handles routing of queries to the respective query handlers.<br/>
Event Store: Stores events (when using Event Sourcing). It can be a JDBC-based store, JPA, or an external store like Axon Server.<br/>

# Axon Server (Optional but Recommended) <a href="https://www.axoniq.io/products/axon-server">Axon Server </a>
Axon Server is an event store and messaging platform designed to work with Axon Framework. It simplifies setting up an event store and handles distributed messaging between Axon applications.

# Axon Server:
Provides an out-of-the-box event store.<br/>
Manages distributed command, event, and query handling.<br/>
Simplifies application scaling and inter-service communication.<br/>

# Database Setup
Depending on your application, you might use:<br/>

JDBC/JPA: For SQL-based event storage or token store.<br/>
MongoDB: For a NoSQL alternative.<br/>
Axon Server: For a built-in event store.<br/>

# Configuration
In a typical Axon application, you need to configure components like:<br/>

Event Storage: Where and how events are stored.<br/>
Token Store: Stores tokens used to track processing progress in event processors.<br/>
Saga Store: Manages the lifecycle of Sagas (long-running business processes).<br/>

# Documentation & Community
Axon Framework Documentation: The official Axon documentation is an excellent resource.<br/>
AxonIQ Community: AxonIQ offers a community where you can ask questions, share knowledge, and get support from other developers.<br/>

# Sample Project
Starting with a simple Axon-based project, such as a basic CQRS application (e.g., our project), will help you grasp the concepts more concretely. Axon Framework's official GitHub repository also has several example projects you can reference.<br/>

# Additional Tools
Axon DevTools: Provides a graphical interface to explore the state of your Axon application.<br/>
Monitoring & Metrics: Consider integrating with tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring Axon applications in production.<br/>

# By setting up these components and understanding these concepts, you'll be well on your way to building robust, scalable applications using Axon Framework.
